Visual aids can be incredibly helpful when learning something new,
especially something involving as many steps as long division.
This app randomly generates long division problems, then walks the
user through each of solving the problem, with hints provided
along the way.

## Features
- Generate random problems based on user input
- Walk users step-by-step through long division problems with visual aids along the way

Additional features that I would like to implement in the future include:
- Visualization of other basic math skills
- Even more visuals for the long division visualizer

## Built With
- Vue.js
- Vuex
